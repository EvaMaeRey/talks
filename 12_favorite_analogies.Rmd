<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I really enjoyed looking through this data viz slide deck by Rhian. A great intro to polar area charts.<br>I like that the idea of showing how your chart is built step by step is catching on - think it helps with comprehension.<br>And where can I get a Florence Nightingale tote? <a href="https://t.co/xiRxBJyGDj">https://t.co/xiRxBJyGDj</a></p>&mdash; Francis Barton (@ludictech) <a href="https://twitter.com/ludictech/status/1279358354775781376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 4, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Simplicity

  - "Let's make it easier" (from the sound of Music) - and the history of solfeggio
  - "I like understanding and explaining things" - David Blackwell
  - flipbooks are a midwestern, 'salt of the earth' project https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQhQuPiBmNU


  - we might prize mental gymnastics -- being able to hold a lot of transformations in your head.  But is this a good idea?  "Check your work!" is the refrain of the middle school math teacher.  

  - Richard Feynman, on scientific affinity - "you have to have a lot of imagination" (but does this have to   mean mental gymnastics...)  Building mental models from something concrete.

Translation

  - And all those language analogies from the last time!
  - "braid together representation" - conversant quantitative

Anti-effort

  - A long stretch of rode with no on or exit ramps (flipbooks give lots of on and exit ramps)
  - Using the magic on the spell book...
  - Boy scooping knowledge from book: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NIR58Z6beQ

  - Data visualization as super highway from data to brain
  - pre-attentive processing of movie

Minimize the creator's role
