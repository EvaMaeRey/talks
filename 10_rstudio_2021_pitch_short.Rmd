Flipbooks created with {flipbookr} and {xaringan} give intuition about coding pipelines by walking through code step-by-step and side-by-side with output. 
They show the series of states from within a single pipeline. States are compared by superimposing one atop the next to deliver a movie-like experience.  Being able to see longer pipelines evolve gives a sense of narrative, and the side-by-side presentation of code and output translates easily between "what" and "how".  New features in {flipbookr} further strengthen comparison, storytelling, and translation capabilities.  The presentation will introduce and demonstrate the new functionality.

`r chunk_reveal("example1", title = "### Flipbooks? ")`

```{r example1, include = F}
cars %>% 
  ggplot() +
  ggthemes::theme_solarized() +
  aes(x = speed) +

## And the package, {flipbookr}?

```{r, out.width="50%", echo = F}

## Strengths up till now: 

##- useful comparison (superimposed states showing before-after changes)

--

##- tracking process gives a sense of narrative

--

##- useful translation (co-evolution of R code <-> output)




---

## New functionality allow for

##- making *more* useful comparisons 

--

##- creating *more powerful* narratives

--

##- doing *more* useful translation



---

# Talk proposal:

##- introduce new functionality

--

##- demo usage

# 1. A tool for *more* useful comparisons

`r chunk_reveal("my_rotate", break_type = "rotate", widths = c(50,50), title = '#### break_type = "rotate" allows for comparison between choices as you cycle through code')`

```{r my_rotate, eval = F, echo = F}
ggplot(data = cars) +
  aes(x = speed) +
  aes(y = dist) +
  geom_point(size = 8,
             shape = 21,

# Create a 'slow essay' using text_reveal().

```{r, echo = F}
"Sometimes, it's helpful to slow down and look at exactly one decision.| Flipbooks present code step-by-step and side-by-side with output.| They parse code pipelines.| And reconstruct code into partial builds.| Then present those builds with their output.| Both code and output are superimposed on the previous state. | This makes seeing what changed --- both in code and output --- easy." ->

# 3. *more* translation capability


---

## `display_type = c("md", "code"), md = c("hi", "by"))`

A series of markdown inputs may co-evolution with code or output


---

`r chunk_reveal("custom_example", md = c("### a value 2", "### assigned to x", "### computing: $$\\frac{1}{x}$$"), display_type = c("md", "code", "output"), title = '### display_type = c("md", "code"), md = c("hi", "by")) md panel allows co-evolution of markdown w/ code or output' )`



```{r custom_example, include = F}
2 ->
  x

1/x
```


---

```{python, cache = F}
import pandas as pd
from vega_datasets import data
import matplotlib.pylab as plt
```


---

`r chunk_reveal("hans", lang = "python", left_assign=TRUE, title = "## translating between python and its output")`

```{python hans, include = F, cache = F}
gap_2000 = data \
  .countries()  \
  .drop(['_comment'], axis = 1) \
  .filter(['country', 'life_expect',
           'year', 'fertility'])
           
gap_2000 = gap_2000[gap_2000.year.eq(2000)] 
```   


---


`r chunk_reveal("plotting1", lang = "python")`

```{python plotting1, include = F}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (10,7))
plt.scatter(x = gap_2000.life_expect, 
            y = gap_2000.fertility)
ax. set_title('Life expectancy and fertility are strongly negatively correlated',  
    fontsize='x-large') 
ax.set_xlabel('life expectancy (years)',
    fontsize='x-large')
ax.set_ylabel('fertility (average number of children)',
    fontsize='x-large')
```


---

## So new functionality adds to core strengths:

--

##- comparison

--

##- narrative

--

##- translation

```{r cars2, include = F}
ggplot(data = cars) +
  aes(x = speed) +
  aes(y = dist) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .8) + 
  aes(size = speed) + 
  aes(color = speed) +
  scale_size(range = c(3,8)) +
  scale_color_viridis_c(option = "magma") +
  labs(title = "Cars") +
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot")
```

# The End!


```{r, code = chunk_code_seq_as_vector("cars2"), echo = F, fig.show="hold", out.width="20%"}
```


```{css, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
.remark-code{line-height: 1.5; font-size: 80%}

@media print {
  .has-continuation {
