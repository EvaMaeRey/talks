During this talk I'm going to show you how you can build a flipbook in five minutes using the flipbookr package and the Rmarkdown slide show tool, Xaringan.

I'll show you three modalities for *revealing* your code incrementally (break_type)

And three modalities for displaying this evolution. (display_type)

Then, I'll make you aware of some of the diversity of use cases where flipbooking may be used.

In the second part of the talk, I'll try to articulate just why I think this tool is valuable as a new communication device, and valuable to add to your tool box.

They may feel like this is the message

breaks down the steps with accompanying output, is something that newcomers have a better chance at following.

Even for seasoned practicioner might not be familiar with all the pieces of a pipeline.  

A seasoned user will probably manage to infer what an unfamiliar function or two are doing in a pipeline, but this requires a lot of mental gymnastics and concentration. 

Flipbooks allow people to narrow in on unfamiliar steps, looking what immediately preceeds and immediately follows.  To alleviate this burden.
