Just as traditional flipbooks let users observe the evolution of a scene, by leafing through it's pages at their own pace ...

... new *code* flipbooks, allow users to observe the evolution of a code pipeline alongside the resulting output.


---

# Flipbooks...

--

## present code and output


## side-by-side


## and step-by-step

## like a *stop-motion movie*
--
, based on someone actually building a code pipeline
--
, checking intermediate output states as they go

As flipbook builders, we choreograph a scene, and mostly stay out of the way. 
Try to make the action in the output tell the story, and go light on narrative (comments).

Hand-crafted, 
Artisanal




???

In 2018, the proto flipbook emerged on the Xaringan platform.  But each frame of the flipbook was individually crafted, which was kind of painstaking.  Garrick Aden-Buie created the first one I know of.  I created another one using SLOWggplot2 --- a totally incremental workflow.  Emi also embraced SLOWggplot2, styled the flipbook with her beautiful kunoichi and ninjutsu .css files and later partially automated flipbooking.

# Do you want to build "flipbooks" together?


???

I wanted to collaborate with these brilliant like-minded people.  And they were game...  (I named  is exactly when flipbooks got their name too!)


---
background-image: url(figures/moth_circling.jpg)

We were kind of all circling around the idea - "flipbooks" had huge potential.  They could deliver a lot of insight about code behavior to their consumers. 




---

# Move to automate


## *Automatically* parsing a block of input code 

--

## *Automatically* reconstructing code into partial builds

--

## *Automatically* delivered on a presentation platform (here Xaringan)


???

Able to do this in large part because of the flexibility of knitr and rmarkdown documents!!!  Garrick and Emi are super expert and knew about some of the knitr secrets that few people know -- at that time the unexported function!  I love Emi's blogpost about this ...

But to realize the full potential, creators needed to be unburdened from copy and paste. Flipbooks were a pain to build manually.  If you made a change in your vision of the overall pipeline, you might have to scrap all your work and start the whole annoying copy paste process again.

# Do I need to use any 'weird tricks' to writing code to be 'flipbooked'?

# Yup.

## Aim for incremental, sequential workflow, where feedback is given at each step.

- ### Piped workflow

  - %>%
  - %>% + .
  - %$%
  


--

- ### right assignment -> instead of = or <- makes it easier to display output

- ### ggplot pipelines - but SLOWggplot is recommended

Today, you can build a flipbook in 5 minutes with the new package flipbookr.  

During this talk I'm going to show you how you can build a flipbook in five minutes using the flipbookr package and the Rmarkdown slide show tool, Xaringan.

I'll show you three modalities for *revealing* your code incrementally (break_type)

And three modalities for displaying this evolution. (display_type)

Then, I'll make you aware of some of the diversity of use cases where flipbooking may be used.

In the second part of the talk, I'll try to articulate just why I think this tool is valuable as a new communication device, and valuable to add to your tool box.

We've tried to make creating flipbooks easy for you.  But it is still a bit of extra effort.  So I want to go back to the topic of why it is a good communication tool.

They may feel like this is the message

breaks down the steps with accompanying output, is something that newcomers have a better chance at following.

Even for seasoned practicioner might not be familiar with all the pieces of a pipeline.  

A seasoned user will probably manage to infer what an unfamiliar function or two are doing in a pipeline, but this requires a lot of mental gymnastics and concentration. 

Flipbooks allow people to narrow in on unfamiliar steps, looking what immediately preceeds and immediately follows.  To alleviate this burden.

???

Lateral comparison is hard; superimposed temporal comparison is easy; Consider the \"spot the differences\" games. Imagine if these images were super imposed.  Flickering back and forth between the two of them, superimposed and aligned, and with changes made incrementally (one-by-one), the challenge would be taken out of the game.

"Visual search" games are fun because they are challenging.

- Visual search relies on visual memory...  Pretty effortful.

# A "Blink Comparator" type experience

This contrasts to temporal offset.
You can see how a user might narrow in on unfamiliar bits, and toggling back and forth between the previous state and the new state.  It's a "blink comparator" type experience..

Blink Comparator, allowed researcher to toggle between two *superimposed* and *aligned* images, to allow you to and noticing what moved between different time periods -- the photos were of the night sky at different time points through a telescope

It's easy to notice motion.  Detecting differences via "motion detection" is the experience flipbooks give us.  

- pretty effortless!!!
